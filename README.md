# 🔧 Formulas Used

## SIP Formula:

Final Amount = P × [(1 + r)^n – 1] / r × (1 + r)

P = monthly installment

r = monthly interest rate (annual rate / 12 / 100)

n = total number of months


## EMI Formula:

EMI = [P × r × (1 + r)^n] / [(1 + r)^n – 1]

P = loan amount

r = monthly interest rate

n = number of months
